Play a game of chance against the computer. Based on the beloved childhood game, rock-paper-scissors, this app is fun for all. Get your sunglasses ready, because my kids helped select the colors and design scheme and, wow, is it bright, fun, and colorful! This app doubles as a stress reducer, as you can sit back and just watch the bubbles float up and pop, so no need to get frustrated if you can't seem to beat the computer, no matter how much it taunts you.
